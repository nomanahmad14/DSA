# 📁 Basic Java Programs

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level Java programs written during my initial learning phase. These programs focus on core programming logic, conditionals, loops, functions, and number-related problems — laying the foundation for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java.

## 📌 What's Included?

### 🔢 Number & Math Problems
- ✅ Armstrong numbers (`armstrong`, `all_armstrong_nums_1_to_N`)
- ✅ Prime numbers & ranges (`prime`, `number_of_primes`, `fun_all_prime_bw_a_to_b`)
- ✅ Factorial, NCR, NPR (`fun_ncr`, `fun_npr`)
- ✅ Fibonacci sequence (`fibonacci`)
- ✅ Binary to decimal conversion (`binary_to_decimal`)
- ✅ Palindrome check (`palindrome`)
- ✅ Sum and product of digits (`fun_sum`, `fun_sum_of_digit`, `product_of_digits`)
- ✅ Power of 2 check (`power_of_two`)
- ✅ Max or Min of two numbers (`max_or_min`)

### 🔁 Looping & Conditions
- ✅ First and last digit (`first_and_last_digit`)
- ✅ Leap year checker (`leapyear`)
- ✅ Do-while and conditional examples (`dowhile`, `char_or_num`)
- ✅ Even or odd using function (`fun_even_or_odd`)

### 🧠 Function-Based Programs
- ✅ Nested functions (`fun_in_fun_ex`)
- ✅ Armstrong & Prime check with functions (`fun_armstron_1_to_n`, `fun_all_prime_bw_a_to_b`)
- ✅ Sum and logic using reusable methods (`fun_sum`, `fun_sum_of_digit`)

### 🔲 Pattern Printing
- ✅ Numeric patterns (`num_pat_1` to `num_pat_5`)
- ✅ Star/shape patterns (`pattern_6` to `pattern_9`, `rohmubs_holow`, `diamond_me`)
